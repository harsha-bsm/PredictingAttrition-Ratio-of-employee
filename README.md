# Predicting Attrition-Ratio-of-employee
####This is an Hacker Earth's problem of predicting Employees Attrition Ratio.

####The problelm statement is finding the attrition ratio of an employee. Metric to use is MSE

#### After performing explorative data analysis, have filled all the NA values with respective medians/means of the features.

#### Vectorised the categorical features using OeehotEncoding and standardised numerical features.

#### Data has been modelled with some of the important machiine learning algorithms like Linear Regression,SVM with linear kernal, SGD Regressor, DecissioinTree regressor, RandomForest and XGboosting. In the end stacking of some of the models have also been performed.

#### Important modules used are Sklearn, Mlxtend, XGboost, Pandas and Numpy
